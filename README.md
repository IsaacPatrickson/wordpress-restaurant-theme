## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

This theme was built as part of my development journey while learning:

* WordPress theme anatomy
* Template hierarchy
* Styling & layout fundamentals
* PHP basics for WordPress
* Building themes from scratch before progressing to
  **custom block themes, ACF blocks, and full client projects**

It reflects my early growth that later enabled me to work on complex features such as the **DCC Propane Distributor Locator Map** and theme components in a real agency environment (Mediaworks).

## 📘 Future Improvements

If further developed, possible enhancements include:

* Converting to a **Block Theme**
* Adding custom ACF fields
* Adding Gutenberg blocks
* Using SCSS or Tailwind
* Adding page builder support
* Implementing theme customiser options
* Turning the menu pages into dynamic CPTs (e.g., `restaurant_item`)
